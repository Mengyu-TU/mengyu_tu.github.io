# Welcome to my website
I am a PhD student in Systems/Computational Neuroscience and an MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at Johns Hopkins University. 
I graduated with BSc Honors in Physics (Highest Distinction) from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 
Currently, I'm diving deep into the fields of neuroscience and machine learning, exploring the exciting intersections between them.
I'm open to collaborating on data science and machine learning projects that drive innovation and solve real-world challenges.
Side interests: Kung Fu, history and philosophy.
